    "# Reminder About Key Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is key distribution?** Secure communication relies on the ability of the sender (Alice) to encrypt the message in a way that the receiver (Bob) can decrypt it but not an eavesdropper. This security is often accomplished with the use of a **key**, which is a piece of information known only to the sender and receiver and enables them to decrypt and encrypt the message. If a key can be securely distributed between the sender and receiver, the encrypted message can be securely sent over a public channel, since without the key, the probability of successfully decrypting the message is tiny.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically, **a key is just a bitstring** - a sequence of 1s and 0s, that is uniquely known only to Alice and Bob, the two communicating parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the problem of secure communication boils down to secure key distribution. QKD is unique because security against eavesdropping is guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics, as opposed to the computational complexity of certain functions, which is what is used in classical key distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will develop qiskit code to implement Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). We will look at the same BB84 protocol that we just discussed in the Workshop. "

    "## The BB84 protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the BB84 protocol is to create and securely share a key, which is just a series of 0s and 1s, between the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob). The BB84 protocol achieves this in 3 phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1 - Sending\n",
    "Alice radomly generates a *bitstring* and a list of *bases*. Some of the bits of the bitstring will make it onto the key. The *bases* can be either X or Z, selected randomly. Next, Alice **encodes** each bit of the bistring into a qubit using the corresponding basis in the list of bases, using the following decision scheme: \n",
    "\n",
    "| bit in bitstring | basis | State Alice encodes |\n",
    "|:----------------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------:|\n",
    "| 0 | Z | $$|0\\rangle$$ |\n",
    "| 1 | Z | $$|1\\rangle$$ |\n",
    "| 0 | X | $$|+\\rangle$$ |\n",
    "| 1 | X | $$|-\\rangle$$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice sends each of these encoded qubits to Bob. So, Alice can send Bob one of **four** possible states - $|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle, |+\\rangle$, and $|-\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2 - Receiving\n",
    "Bob receives this qubit, and needs to measure them to find out their state. Bob generates a random list of bases, either X or Z, and measures each of the qubits he receives in the corresponding basis to generate his own bitstring. If Bob measures the qubit in the same basis that Alice had encoded it in, he will get the same bit as a result of that measurement as Alice had encoded. If Bob measures the qubit in a different basis, he is not guaranteed to get the same bit as Alice. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3 - Comparing\n",
    "Therefore, after Bob has measured all qubits that Alice sent him, Alice and Bob publically declare their list of bases, and drop the bits from their respective bitstrings for which their **bases do not match**. The remaining bits, for which their bases match, are **guaranteed to match** as long as no one was eavesdropping when Alice sent Bob her qubits. Therefore, to find out if someone was eavesdropping, Alice and Bob can compare the first few bits of their respective keys and see if they match.\n",
